== Running the website locally

You can run your own Hugo server using docker to preview the site locally:

. Install https://www.docker.com/[docker].
. Fork the https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/tetrabiodistributed.github.io[tetrabiodistributed.github.io repo], then create a local copy using `git clone`. Don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<your_github_username>/tetrabiodistributed.github.io.git
cd tetrabiodistributed.github.io
----
. Run the `build.sh` script in the site root directory (Note: Linux users may need to prepend this command `sudo`). This will build a docker image, as well as install node modules, needed to locally run the `tetrabiodistributed.github.io` Hugo webserver. Once the image is built and stored on your machine, you do not need to rerun this step. You can view all locally installed images by running `docker images`.
+
[source,bash]
----
bash build.sh
----
. Run the `serve.sh` script in the site root directory (Note: Linux users may need to prepend this command `sudo`). By default, your site will be available at `+http://localhost:1313+`.
+
[source,bash]
----
bash serve.sh
----
. Now that you're serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.
